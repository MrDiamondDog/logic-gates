# Logic Gate Simulator

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e265c126-a79d-4706-80c8-b535bee8edeb/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/mrdiamond-logic-sim/deploys)

A simple app made in Typescript/HTML that runs in any browser. Very experimental and buggy. 

Heavily inspired by [Sebastion Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague)'s [Digital Logic Sim](https://github.com/SebLague/Digital-Logic-Sim) and [Exploring How Computers Work](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0dPhqVsKt1Ni_46ARyiCGSq) series.
