# Logic Gate Simulator
A simple app made in Typescript/HTML that runs in any browser. Very experimental and buggy. 

Heavily inspired by [Sebastion Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague)'s [Digital Logic Sim](https://github.com/SebLague/Digital-Logic-Sim) and [Exploring How Computers Work](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0dPhqVsKt1Ni_46ARyiCGSq) series.
